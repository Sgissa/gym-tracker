## This is my gym tracker app

## Why

I was using a gym tracker app and they are blocking the features behind a pay wall. So i am building my own to challenge my software dev skills and learn

## entery 1

I started by trying to build the routine feature this lets you add your excercies together for a workout and you can store workouts into a routine.

## problem 1

starting it like this was confusing because i didn't relise i need to have the data ready and accessible to allow the ability to add exercises into their workout.

## idea

Since i am using api. i am going to create a file responsible for fetching the api calls and making that data accessible to the rest of my app. So step 1 connect my web-app to the exercisesDB API
